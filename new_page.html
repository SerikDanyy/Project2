			<p>The XXXII Summer Olympic Games will be held from July 24 to August 9, 2020 in Tokyo, Japan. Sixty-six years after the 1964 Olympics, the capital of Japan will once again become the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics. According to the organizers, the future Olympics will be the most innovative ever held. The basis of the Games concept  will consist of three fundamental principles of improving the world: the desire for personal success (achieving your best "I"); accepting each other (unity in diversity); continuity of generations (connection with the future). In addition, five new sports have added to the Tokyo Olympics program: baseball / softball, karate, surfing, sport climbing and skateboarding.

According to the adopted reforms of the Olympic Agenda 2020, during the Games in Tokyo, existing sports facilities will be used, namely those that were built for the 1964 Olympics. At the same time, the stadium, where the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games are scheduled to take place, will become a completely new facility, built specifically for the 2020 Games. At one time, Japan became the first country in the Asian continent, where the Olympic Games were held. The 2020 Olympics will be the fourth Olympics after the 1972 and 1998 Winter Olympics in Sapporo and Nagano.

The vote on the choice of the city was held on September 7 2013 at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires. Then Tokyo was chosen ahead of other competitors - the cities of Istanbul and Madrid.

Olympic Logo
<div ><img src="1563882374.jpg" class="text11"></div>

The winner logo, selected from four finalists, is made in white and blue colors. The new Olympic emblem looks like a ring made of a checkerboard pattern. In the emblem of the Paralympic Games, the chess pattern forms a semblance of a bowl. This design was popular in Japan during the Edo era (1603â€“1867). In the context of the Olympics, it symbolizes the diversity of the world, different countries and cultures.</p>
